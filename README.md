# AndroidStudio-AD340
Repo for Android Studio work for Mobile Dev class AD340.

## Create a new project in Android Studio
 - include a name that will be appropriate as you extend the application throughout this course.
 Be sure to use a unique 'domain' name, as it will be difficult to change later.

 - Select a minimum API level that works for at least 80% of Android devices. For now, it's ok to support just phones in portrait mode.

 - Your app should have a main activity that displays a custom title, your name, and any other fun facts about yourself when the application runs.


## UI Layouts (Homework 2)
 - Add a text entry field and 'send' button to your main activity.
   - The text field should have fixed spacing to the left edge of the screen and to the button on it's right. Field width should vary according to screen size. The button should have fixed spacing on it's right to the screen edge.

 - Add a 2 x 2 grid of buttons below the text entry field.
   - Each button should have unique text. The left edge of the grid should be aligned with the text field, and right edge should be aligned with the screen margin.
   - *Spacing between each column of buttons should vary according to screen size.*

 - Enable each button with a click event, where tapping the button displays a 'toast' specific to that button. 

 - UI elements should be fully visible on a range of phone screen sizes.

 - Text strings should be defined in a resource file separate from your layout elements.
