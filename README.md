Repo for Android Studio work for Mobile Dev class AD340.

## Create a new project in Android Studio
 - include a name that will be appropriate as you extend the application throughout this course.
 Be sure to use a unique 'domain' name, as it will be difficult to change later.

 - Select a minimum API level that works for at least 80% of Android devices. For now, it's ok to support just phones in portrait mode.

 - Your app should have a main activity that displays a custom title, your name, and any other fun facts about yourself when the application runs.
